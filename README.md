# HR-React-Code-Challenge

## Deployed: https://stark-savannah-90769.herokuapp.com/


## Criteria

`1.) Create a list of objects (similar to the organization/team list you did in the previous challenge)`

`2.) Create an "Add" button`

`3.) Pressing the "Add" button would display a form which would allow the user to add a new item to the list`

`4.) The form should include different types of form elements (Text box, select menu, checkbox, radio button, and submit button)`

`5.) Submitting the form will add the item to the end of the list`

`6.) Each item in the list should contain an "Edit" button`

`7.) Clicking on the edit button should display the form with the values from that item pre-populated`

`8.) Submitting the form after editing values should update the list display with the new values`

`9.) Some of the form fields should be required and the user shouldn't be able to submit the form without completing those fields (should display an appropriate error message to the user)`

## How it Works

* The user will have a simple sundae app to allow them to choose a "Classic" sundae from a list, which can be added to the cart.
* If the user prefers to customize their order, that can click the "+Start Your Custom Sundae" button, where they will be presented with a form to choose their options.
* The user will not be allowed to click the Submit button until they have selected all field in the form.
* The user can add and delete items from their cart, as well as edit their custom order.
