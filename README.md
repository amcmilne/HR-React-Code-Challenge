# HR-React-Code-Challenge

## Criteria

`1.) Create a list of objects (similar to the organization/team list you did in the previous challenge)`

`2.) Create an "Add" button`

`3.) Pressing the "Add" button would display a form which would allow the user to add a new item to the list`

`4.) The form should include different types of form elements (Text box, select menu, checkbox, radio button, and submit button)`

`5.) Submitting the form will add the item to the end of the list`

`6.) Each item in the list should contain an "Edit" button`

`7.) Clicking on the edit button should display the form with the values from that item pre-populated`

`8.) Submitting the form after editing values should update the list display with the new values`

`9.) Some of the form fields should be required and the user shouldn't be able to submit the form without completing those fields (should display an appropriate error message to the user)`
